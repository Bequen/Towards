My bachelor project.

Simple 3D rendering engine.

Input glTF file, output colors.

Implemented:
- [x] GBuffer
- [x] Simple OpenGL backend
- [x] glTF file support (yet only meshes, not textures)
- [ ] MaterialX support
- [ ] Vulkan backend
- [ ] GTAO (ambient occlusion technique by blizzard)
- [ ] Bloom (bloom.. [the one from Doom 2016 looks cool](http://www.adriancourreges.com/blog/2016/09/09/doom-2016-graphics-study/#bloom))
- [ ] GPU driven rendering
